# Project Title: JDS Capstone: Target Market Analysis 

This project is a work focused on analyzing a target market. The data provided contains historical customer purchase information, with two key columns: `Potential_Customer` and `Cust_Last_Purchase`. These represent customer responses to a recent advertisement. 

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains various features. Unfortunately, a visual representation of the feature description was used in the notebook and cannot be adequately transposed into a README file. Please refer to the original notebook for the details.

## Objectives

1. Design a predictive model to determine potential customers who will make a purchase if sent an advertisement. The target variable is `Potential_Customer`. Note: The `Cust_Last_Purchase` column, which relates to the target variable, must be excluded from the model.

2. Calculate the value and revenue of the model. This will involve the calculation of cost, loss, gain, value, and revenue based on assumptions provided in the project. The best model will be chosen based on these calculations.

3. Compare the revenue of the best model with the revenue of the default solution, which involves sending advertisements to all customers in the test set.

4. The model's performance will also be evaluated on a hypothetical future scenario involving a target group of 30,000 similar customers.

The notebook includes the following steps:

- Data Wrangling - Cleaning & Merging
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Data Pre-Processing
- Model Design
- Model Evaluation
- Bonus (any creative idea for improving machine learning models)


## Results

Detailed results and insights from the analysis are presented in the Jupyter Notebook. Please refer to the notebook for a comprehensive understanding of the project outcomes.
